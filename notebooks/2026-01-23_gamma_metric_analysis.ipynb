   "source": "# Gamma Metric Hypothesis Analysis\n\n**Date:** 2026-01-23  \n**Experiment ID:** gamma_metric_analysis  \n**Status:** Complete\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Hypothesis\n\n### Problem Statement\nOur best model achieves only **31.2% Gamma pass rate** (3%/3mm), far below the **95% clinical target**. Before pursuing more complex solutions (more data, new architectures), we need to ask:\n\n**Is overall Gamma actually the right metric for evaluating dose prediction quality?**\n\n### The Insight\n\nGamma measures similarity to ONE specific reference plan. But consider:\n\n1. **Clinical Reality:** As long as PTV objectives and OAR constraints are met, clinicians are satisfied. The exact dose distribution in \"no-man's land\" (between PTVs and OARs) doesn't matter clinically.\n\n2. **Physical Reality:** Multiple dose distributions could be physically deliverable for the same patient. Each training case may have a different (but valid) low-dose pattern.\n\n3. **Model Behavior:** If training cases have different low-dose patterns, our model learns to predict the **average** of these patterns - which may be:\n   - Clinically acceptable (DVH constraints still pass)\n   - But physically implausible (blurred average of valid solutions)\n   - And low Gamma (doesn't match any specific reference)\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n**If our predictions pass clinical DVH constraints and achieve high Gamma in PTV regions, then overall Gamma is a misleading metric that penalizes valid variations in clinically irrelevant regions.**\n\n### Implications\n\n| If True | Then |\n|---------|------|\n| Model is already clinically useful | We have a metric problem, not a model problem |\n| Low-dose variation is expected | DDPM/generative models may be more appropriate |\n| 95% overall Gamma may be unrealistic | Need to define clinically relevant metrics |"

Analysis and Discussion\n\n### 6.1 Key Questions Answered\n\n1. **Do predictions pass clinical constraints?**\n   - **PARTIAL:** OAR constraints pass (100%), but PTV coverage fails\n   - The model is \"too conservative\" - protecting OARs at the expense of PTVs\n\n2. **Is PTV Gamma much higher than overall Gamma?**\n   - **YES:** PTV Gamma (41.5%) is 10% higher than overall (31.2%)\n   - This confirms that the model is more accurate in PTV regions\n   - But 41.5% is still far below clinical acceptability (95%)\n\n3. **Does low-dose region have lowest Gamma?**\n   - **NO:** Low-dose Gamma (30.4%) is similar to overall (31.2%)\n   - **Surprise:** OAR Gamma (17.3%) is the LOWEST!\n   - This suggests the model struggles with OAR dose gradients, not just \"no-man's land\"\n\n### 6.2 Hypothesis Evaluation\n\n| Finding | Hypothesis Support | Reality |\n|---------|-------------------|---------|\n| PTV Gamma > Overall | **SUPPORTED** (41.5% > 31.2%) | Model more accurate in PTVs |\n| DVH constraints pass | **MIXED** - OARs pass, PTVs fail | Model underdoses PTVs |\n| Low-dose variation | **NOT SUPPORTED** | OAR region is the weak point |\n\n**The original hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED but reveals a more serious issue:**\n- Overall Gamma IS somewhat misleading (PTV accuracy is higher)\n- But the model has a **REAL clinical problem**: systematic PTV underdosing\n\n### 6.3 Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Why is the model underdosing PTVs?**\n\n1. **MSE Loss Symmetry:** MSE treats overdose and underdose equally, but clinically:\n   - PTV underdose = treatment failure (tumor recurrence)\n   - PTV slight overdose = acceptable (within tolerance)\n\n2. **Conservative Learning:** The model may be learning to avoid high doses near OARs (where training cases vary) by generally predicting lower doses everywhere.\n\n3. **Limited Training Data:** With only 23 cases, the model may not have learned the correct dose levels.\n\n### 6.4 Key Insight: The 7-8 Gy Gap\n\nThe model consistently underdoses PTVs by ~7-8 Gy compared to ground truth:\n- This corresponds to approximately **10% of prescription dose**\n- In clinical terms, this is the difference between:\n  - 95% PTV coverage (acceptable) vs\n  - 85% PTV coverage (unacceptable)\n\n### 6.5 Implications for Next Steps\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Asymmetric PTV loss | Directly penalizes underdosing | May overcorrect |\n| DVH-aware D95 loss | Already implemented, clinically motivated | Slow, complex |\n| Scale correction | Simple post-processing | Doesn't fix learning |\n| More training data | Fundamental improvement | Requires more cases |"

Conclusions\n\n### 7.1 Main Finding\n\n**The model systematically underdoses PTVs by 7-8 Gy (10% of prescription), failing to meet PTV D95 clinical constraints while perfectly meeting all OAR constraints.**\n\nThis reveals a **real clinical problem** (not just a metric problem):\n- The model has learned to be too conservative\n- It protects OARs at the expense of PTV coverage\n- This would result in inadequate tumor treatment\n\n### 7.2 Hypothesis Outcome\n\nThe original hypothesis (\"Overall Gamma is misleading\") is **partially supported**:\n- PTV Gamma (41.5%) > Overall Gamma (31.2%) confirms better accuracy where it matters\n- BUT the hypothesis didn't anticipate that DVH constraints would fail in PTVs\n\nThe analysis revealed a more fundamental issue: **systematic PTV underdosing**.\n\n### 7.3 Revised Success Metrics\n\nBased on this analysis, we propose:\n\n| Metric | Threshold | Priority | Status |\n|--------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| PTV D95 compliance | 100% pass | **Critical** | **FAILING** |\n| OAR constraint compliance | 100% pass | **Critical** | PASSING |\n| PTV Gamma (3%/3mm) | >= 80% | Secondary | 41.5% (failing) |\n| Overall Gamma | Report only | Informational | 31.2% |\n\n### 7.4 Recommendations\n\n1. **Immediate:** Add asymmetric loss that heavily penalizes PTV underdosing\n2. **Short-term:** Fine-tune with DVH-aware loss emphasizing D95\n3. **Medium-term:** Acquire more training data (100+ cases)\n4. **Long-term:** Consider physical deliverability constraints"

Next Steps\n\n### 8.1 Proposed Next Experiment: Asymmetric PTV Loss\n\n**Hypothesis:** Adding an asymmetric loss that penalizes PTV underdosing more heavily than overdosing will improve D95 coverage without sacrificing OAR sparing.\n\n**Implementation:**\n```python\nclass AsymmetricPTVLoss(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"\n    Penalizes PTV underdosing 3x more than overdosing.\n    - Underdose (pred < target): weight = 3.0\n    - Overdose (pred > target): weight = 1.0\n    \"\"\"\n    def forward(self, pred, target, ptv_mask):\n        error = pred - target\n        weights = torch.where(error < 0, 3.0, 1.0)  # Asymmetric\n        weighted_mse = (weights * ptv_mask * error**2).mean()\n        return weighted_mse\n```\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n- Higher PTV D95 values (closer to ground truth)\n- May slightly increase OAR doses (acceptable trade-off)\n- Improved Gamma in PTV regions\n\n### 8.2 Alternative: Stronger DVH-Aware Loss\n\nThe existing DVH-aware loss already has D95 terms, but with low weight. Options:\n1. Increase `dvh_d95_weight` from 10.0 to 50.0\n2. Add explicit minimum D95 constraint term\n3. Make D95 loss asymmetric (only penalize low D95)\n\n### 8.3 Longer-term Considerations\n\n| Approach | Description | When to Try |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| DDPM/Flow | Generative model for sharper outputs | After fixing D95 issue |\n| Attention U-Net | Better long-range dependencies | If asymmetric loss insufficient |\n| More data (100+) | Fundamental improvement | When available |\n| TPS integration | Verify physical deliverability | After acceptable metrics |"
