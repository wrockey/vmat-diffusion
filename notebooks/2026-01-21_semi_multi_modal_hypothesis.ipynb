    "# Semi-Multi-Modal Hypothesis for VMAT Dose Prediction\n",

    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents a key insight that may change our approach to dose prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** Dose prediction is not purely deterministic. While PTV coverage and OAR constraints are hard requirements, the low/intermediate dose distribution in \"no-man's land\" (transition regions between PTVs and OARs) is flexible - multiple valid solutions exist as long as DVH constraints are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:**\n",
    "1. Our current pixel-wise metrics (MAE, Gamma) may be too strict\n",
    "2. DDPM's \"blurring\" may be averaging valid solutions, not failing\n",
    "3. DVH-aware losses may unlock clinically-focused optimization\n",
    "4. DDPM may be viable with proper region-aware metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:** Test DVH-aware loss on baseline U-Net before revisiting DDPM."

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Why We Dismissed DDPM\n",
    "\n",
    "After Phase 1 DDPM optimization experiments (2026-01-20), we concluded:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Observation | Original Interpretation |\n",
    "|-------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| \"More steps = worse\" | Structural issue - model denoises away dose signal |\n",
    "| Near-zero sample variability | Model is deterministic, not generative |\n",
    "| DDPM = Baseline accuracy | Added complexity provides no benefit |\n",
    "| 50/1000 steps optimal | Essentially one-shot prediction |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** \"Dose prediction is deterministic (one correct answer per patient). Diffusion models excel at multi-modal generation. We're forcing a generative framework onto a regression problem.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 What We May Have Missed\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment treated dose prediction as **fully deterministic**, overlooking that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clinical acceptability is defined by **DVH constraints**, not pixel-perfect reproduction\n",
    "2. Multiple dose distributions can satisfy the same constraints\n",
    "3. Low-dose \"spray\" in non-critical regions varies significantly between equally valid plans"

    "\n",
    "### 4.1 \"More Steps = Worse\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original interpretation:** Model denoises away dose signal (structural failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative interpretation:** With more steps, model converges to the **mean** of multiple valid solutions. This mean is blurred/averaged, producing higher MAE against a single ground truth that is just one of many valid options.\n",

    "### 4.2 \"Near-Zero Sample Variability\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original interpretation:** Model is deterministic, not generative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative interpretation:** Model learned to output the average of valid solutions. The variability is collapsed because we trained with pixel-wise loss that penalizes any deviation, forcing convergence to mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 \"DDPM = Baseline Accuracy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original interpretation:** DDPM provides no benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative interpretation:** Both converge to same average because both use pixel-wise losses. DDPM's generative capacity is suppressed, not absent.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**If we relax metrics in flexible regions and focus on DVH compliance, would DDPM show meaningful diversity in valid dose distributions?**"
